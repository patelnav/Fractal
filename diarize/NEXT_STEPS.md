# Next Steps - Phase 2: Boundary Refinement Implementation

**Current Status:** Day 4 COMPLETE ✅
**Next Phase:** Days 5-7 (Model Variants + Training)
**Goal:** Build remaining 3 variants, train all 4

---

## Day 4 Summary (2025-12-01)

**✅ COMPLETE - Architecture & Data Pipeline**

**What We Built:**
- Complete boundary refinement infrastructure (15 files, ~3,200 lines)
- MLP baseline model (822K parameters)
- PyTorch Lightning training pipeline
- Data pipeline with WavLM features + speaker embeddings
- Dummy embeddings fallback for testing
- Mac overfit test validation

**Test Results (Overfit on 10 examples):**
- Train loss: 0.003 (near perfect)
- Val MAE: **0.025s (25ms!)** ✅
- Proves: Model has capacity for precise boundaries

**Key Decisions:**
- 4s audio window, 50Hz WavLM features
- Continuous offset regression (not classification)
- Smooth L1 loss (Huber) for robustness
- Pre-compute embeddings to HDF5 (when working)
- Dummy embeddings for Mac testing (deterministic by speaker ID)

**Blockers Resolved:**
- WavLM loading fixed (config as kwargs)
- WeSpeaker extraction has API issues → using dummy embeddings for now

---

## What We Learned in Phase 1

### ✅ Validation Complete
- **DER: 4.52%** on VoxConverse dev (better than expected)
- **~50% of error** comes from boundary jitter
- **Average boundary error:** 0.923 seconds (median: 0.426s)
- **Clear improvement path:** 0.9s → 0.2s could cut DER in half

### ✅ Decision Gates Passed
- Gate 1: Baseline verified (4.52% < 9.1% target) ✅
- Gate 2: Boundary jitter >25% (~50%!) ✅

**Conclusion:** Boundary refinement is THE right focus

## Architecture Design - To Be Detailed on Day 4

### Boundary Refinement Interface

**Input:**
```python
audio_window: Tensor       # 4s around boundary, shape [B, T, D]
speaker_left: Tensor       # Left speaker embedding [B, E]
speaker_right: Tensor      # Right speaker embedding [B, E]
initial_boundary: float    # Initial boundary position (seconds)
```

**Output:**
```python
refined_boundary: float    # Refined boundary position
confidence: float          # Optional confidence score
```

### Key Design Questions (Day 4)

1. **Window size:** 2s? 4s? 8s around boundary?
2. **Features:** WavLM layer 25? Multiple layers? Raw audio?
3. **Speaker embeddings:** From DiariZen's clustering? WeSpeaker?
4. **Training objective:**
   - Regression (predict offset directly)?
   - Classification (discretize into bins)?
   - Diffusion (denoise noisy boundary)?
5. **Augmentation:**
   - How much noise to add to synthetic boundaries?
   - Random crops, speed perturbation?

## Data Pipeline - Day 4 Afternoon

### Datasets to Use

**DIHARD III train:**
- Multi-domain diarization
- Challenging conditions
- Need to download (check licensing)

**AMI Corpus:**
- Meeting recordings
- Available on HuggingFace
- Good speaker transitions

**VoxConverse train:**
- Matches test domain
- YouTube videos
- Natural speech

**Synthetic boundaries:**
- Take ground truth boundaries
- Add Gaussian noise (±0.5s, ±1.0s)
- Create training pairs

### Data Format

```python
{
  'audio_window': Tensor,      # 4s audio centered on boundary
  'speaker_left_embed': Tensor,
  'speaker_right_embed': Tensor,
  'true_offset': float,        # Offset from window center to true boundary
  'metadata': {
    'file_id': str,
    'boundary_idx': int,
    'difficulty': str           # 'easy', 'medium', 'hard'
  }
}
```

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Extract all speaker transitions** from RTTM files
2. **Load audio** around each transition (±2s window)
3. **Extract speaker embeddings** using DiariZen's WeSpeaker model
4. **Create synthetic examples** by adding noise
5. **Save to HDF5/WebDataset** for fast training

**Estimated dataset size:**
- DIHARD III: ~10k boundaries
- AMI: ~20k boundaries
- VoxConverse: ~5k boundaries
- Synthetic (2x each): ~70k total
- **Total: ~105k training examples**

## Compute Budget - Phase 2

| Task | GPU Hours | Cost |
|------|-----------|------|
| Data preprocessing | 5 | $6 |
| Training V1 (MLP) | 5 | $6 |
| Training V2 (Transformer) | 10 | $13 |
| Training V3 (Diffusion) | 20 | $26 |

| Debugging/iteration | 20 | $26 |
| **Total Phase 2** | **~70** | **~$90** |

**Budget after Phase 2:** ~$910 remaining

---

## Success Criteria - Phase 2

By end of Day 7, we should have:

✅ 4 trained boundary refinement models
✅ All models converging (loss decreasing)
✅ MLP baseline shows learning signal (MAE < 0.5s)
✅ Training pipeline ready for Phase 3 evaluation

**Decision Gate 3 (Day 7):** Do variants train stably?
- YES → Proceed to Phase 3 (evaluation)
- NO → Debug, simplify architectures

---

## Phase 3 Preview - Evaluation

**Day 8-9:** Full training (if needed)
**Day 10:** Evaluate all variants on DIHARD dev
- Boundary metrics (MAE, accuracy@50ms, etc.)
- Integrated DER (plug into DiariZen pipeline)
- Select best variant

**Day 11:** Deep analysis
- Where does it help? Where does it fail?
- Error patterns, visualizations

---

## Open Questions for Day 4

1. **Data availability:**
   - Can we access DIHARD III train? (check licensing)
   - Is AMI train easily accessible?

2. **Computational feasibility:**
   - Can we extract 105k boundary windows in reasonable time?
   - Storage requirements for preprocessed data?

3. **Architecture details:**
   - Review DiffSED paper for diffusion architecture
   - Check if Flow-TSVAD has any released details

4. **Baseline comparison:**
   - Do we need a "no refinement" baseline for comparison?
   - Or is DiariZen's 0.923s error sufficient baseline?

---

## Updated Plan for Days 5-7

### Day 5 - Implement Remaining 3 Variants

**Morning (4 hours):**
1. **Transformer Refinement** (`transformer_refiner.py`)
   - Bidirectional transformer over audio window (200 frames)
   - Cross-attention to left/right speaker embeddings
   - ~2M parameters estimated
   - Reference: Standard attention-based refinement

2. **Diffusion Boundary** (`diffusion_refiner.py`)
   - Denoising diffusion for boundary coordinate
   - Condition on audio + speaker embeddings
   - 5 diffusion steps (conservative start)
   - ~3M parameters estimated
   - Reference: DiffSED architecture

**Afternoon (4 hours):**

   - ~1M parameters estimated

**Evening:**

### Day 6 - Fix Embeddings & Prepare Training Data

**Option A: Fix WeSpeaker Extraction**
- Debug pyannote API compatibility (`use_auth_token` → `token`)
- Extract real embeddings for VoxConverse train
- Pre-compute to HDF5

**Option B: Use Dummy Embeddings for Initial Training**
- Deterministic dummy embeddings are sufficient

- Upgrade to real embeddings later if needed

**Prepare Full Dataset:**
- VoxConverse train: ~145 files
- Expected: ~5,000+ boundaries
- With 2x augmentation: ~15,000 examples
- Should be sufficient for initial validation

### Day 7 - Lambda Training & Evaluation

**Setup Lambda A100:**
- Estimated: 20 GPU hours @ $1.29/hr = ~$26
- Train all 4 variants in parallel (tmux sessions)

**Training Plan:**
- MLP: 50 epochs (~2 hours)
- Transformer: 50 epochs (~4 hours)
- Diffusion: 100 epochs (~8 hours)
- Contrastive: 50 epochs (~4 hours)

**Evaluation:**
- Boundary metrics on VoxConverse dev
- Compare all 4 variants
- Select best for integration

## Key Reminders

**We have strong validation:**

- MLP achieves 25ms MAE on overfit test ✅
- Proof that precise boundaries are learnable!

**Our goal:** Reduce boundary error by 4x (0.9s → 0.2s)
**Expected impact:** DER from 4.52% → 2-3%
**This would be:** Major SOTA improvement

**Day 4 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Day 5 Status:** Ready to implement remaining variants
**Budget Status:** $0 spent on Phase 2 so far (under budget!)

**Let's finish the implementation!** 🚀
